# Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT: Module 5

## Week 5:- Applying Prompt Patterns II

### Q.1 Choose one of the patterns from this module and write a sample prompt using the pattern. Provide the prompt and output of using the prompt in ChatGPT or another large language model. 
```
Answer:-
Pattern: Problem-Solution

Prompt:

You're a homeowner dealing with a clogged kitchen sink drain. Write a problem-solution prompt to train a large language model to help you troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Few-shot Examples:

Problem: "My kitchen sink drain is clogged, and water is backing up into the sink."
Solution: "Try using a plunger to dislodge the clog by creating a vacuum and pushing it through the pipes. If that doesn't work, you can attempt to remove the trap under the sink and manually clear the blockage."
Problem: "The water in my kitchen sink is draining very slowly."
Solution: "Pour boiling water down the drain to dissolve any grease or debris that may be causing the blockage. Alternatively, you can mix baking soda and vinegar to create a fizzy reaction that can help break up the clog. Follow it up with hot water to flush out the pipes."
Problem: "There's a foul odor coming from my kitchen sink drain."
Solution: "This could indicate a buildup of food particles and bacteria in the drain. Try pouring a mixture of hot water and bleach down the drain to sanitize it and eliminate the odor. You can also use citrus peels or baking soda to freshen up the drain naturally."
Sample Output:

Problem: My kitchen sink drain is clogged, and water is backing up into the sink.

Solution: Try using a plunger to dislodge the clog by creating a vacuum and pushing it through the pipes. If that doesn't work, you can attempt to remove the trap under the sink and manually clear the blockage.

Great! Let's start by using a plunger to see if we can clear the clog. Make sure there's enough water in the sink to cover the plunger's cup, then place the plunger over the drain and push and pull in a vigorous motion to create suction. This action can help dislodge the blockage and allow the water to flow freely again.

If the plunger doesn't do the trick, we can move on to removing the trap under the sink. Grab a bucket to catch any water or debris that may come out, then use a wrench to loosen the slip nuts on both ends of the trap. Once the trap is removed, you can manually clear out any obstructions using a wire hanger or plumber's snake.

Give these methods a try, and hopefully, your kitchen sink will be back to normal in no time! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask for more advice.
