# Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT: Module 5

## Week 5:- Applying Prompt Patterns II

### Q.1 Choose one of the patterns from this module and write a sample prompt using the pattern. Provide the prompt and output of using the prompt in ChatGPT or another large language model. 
```
Answer:-
Pattern: Problem-Solution

Prompt:

You're a homeowner dealing with a clogged kitchen sink drain. Write a problem-solution prompt to train a large language model to help you troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Few-shot Examples:

Problem: "My kitchen sink drain is clogged, and water is backing up into the sink."
Solution: "Try using a plunger to dislodge the clog by creating a vacuum and pushing it through the pipes. If that doesn't work, you can attempt to remove the trap under the sink and manually clear the blockage."
Problem: "The water in my kitchen sink is draining very slowly."
Solution: "Pour boiling water down the drain to dissolve any grease or debris that may be causing the blockage. Alternatively, you can mix baking soda and vinegar to create a fizzy reaction that can help break up the clog. Follow it up with hot water to flush out the pipes."
Problem: "There's a foul odor coming from my kitchen sink drain."
Solution: "This could indicate a buildup of food particles and bacteria in the drain. Try pouring a mixture of hot water and bleach down the drain to sanitize it and eliminate the odor. You can also use citrus peels or baking soda to freshen up the drain naturally."
Sample Output:

Problem: My kitchen sink drain is clogged, and water is backing up into the sink.

Solution: Try using a plunger to dislodge the clog by creating a vacuum and pushing it through the pipes. If that doesn't work, you can attempt to remove the trap under the sink and manually clear the blockage.

Great! Let's start by using a plunger to see if we can clear the clog. Make sure there's enough water in the sink to cover the plunger's cup, then place the plunger over the drain and push and pull in a vigorous motion to create suction. This action can help dislodge the blockage and allow the water to flow freely again.

If the plunger doesn't do the trick, we can move on to removing the trap under the sink. Grab a bucket to catch any water or debris that may come out, then use a wrench to loosen the slip nuts on both ends of the trap. Once the trap is removed, you can manually clear out any obstructions using a wire hanger or plumber's snake.

Give these methods a try, and hopefully, your kitchen sink will be back to normal in no time! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask for more advice.
```

### Q.2 Choose another one of the patterns from this module and write a sample prompt using the pattern. This prompt must be applied to some information that you provide in the prompt before the pattern. Provide the prompt and output of using the prompt in ChatGPT or another large language model.

A prompt pattern is a structured approach used in programming conversational large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to customize their outputs and interactions. In simpler terms, a prompt pattern is a set of instructions that you provide to an LLM to guide it in generating specific types of content or responses. For example, if you work in marketing, a prompt pattern could be designed to extract key insights from customer feedback data. The purpose of this pattern would be to help the LLM analyze customer sentiments and preferences from the dataset, requiring the data to include customer feedback and reviews. The prompt for this pattern could be: "Analyze the customer feedback data to identify common themes and sentiments. Provide a summary of the main issues raised by customers and any positive feedback trends."
Another example could be a prompt pattern for someone interested in sports analytics. This pattern could aim to extract statistics and trends from a sports performance dataset. The problem it solves is to help analyze player performance and team strategies based on historical data. The data needed would be the sports performance dataset containing player statistics, match outcomes, and team strategies. The prompt for this pattern could be: "Analyze the sports performance dataset to identify key player performance metrics and trends. Provide insights into player strengths, weaknesses, and correlations between performance metrics and match outcomes."
These sample prompt patterns demonstrate how you can use structured instructions to guide an LLM in analyzing specific datasets related to your job or interests. By providing clear prompts tailored to your domain, you can leverage the power of LLMs like ChatGPT to extract valuable insights and information from complex datasets.
